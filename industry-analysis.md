# Industry Analysis: Event Discovery in Toronto

*Last updated: September 26, 2026 · Sources are linked inline and listed at the end.*

---

## Summary

**Verdict: viable, but only as a focused wedge with revenue from hosts. A consumer-only discovery app is not a sustainable business on its own.**

The event discovery and ticketing industry is consolidating, and standalone discovery has a poor track record:

- **Consolidation:** Eventbrite sold for roughly $500M, about 71% below its IPO valuation [[1]](#sources)[[2]](#sources). Fever bought DICE [[3]](#sources). Bending Spoons now owns both Eventbrite and Meetup [[1]](#sources)[[4]](#sources).
- **Failure:** IRL, a well-funded social events app, shut down after admitting 95% of its users were fake [[5]](#sources).
- **Money:** Partiful is loved by Gen Z but still has no revenue model [[6]](#sources).

Demand is also under pressure:

- **Spending:** 44% of Canadians plan to spend less on entertainment in 2026, and 86% of Gen Z plan budget cuts [[7]](#sources).
- **Going out less:** UK research shows young people going out less because of cost [[8]](#sources)[[9]](#sources).
- **Spotify:** our "Spotify for local events" positioning now overlaps with a feature Spotify ships itself: *Concerts Near You* and a daily Live Events feed [[10]](#sources)[[11]](#sources).

The opportunities are real, though:

- **Paid IRL experiences:** Timeleft reached €18M in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by selling dinners with strangers [[12]](#sources).
- **Personalized discovery:** Posh built a TikTok-style personalized event feed and grew to nearly 6M users and $10M revenue in 2024 [[13]](#sources).
- **Toronto policy:** Toronto loosened nightlife rules in 2025 and treats the night economy as a growth priority [[14]](#sources).
- **Local market:** the city's live music venues alone are worth about $850M a year [[15]](#sources).

### Recommended actions

| # | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Make hosts the paying customer.** Charge for Demand Signals insights and promoted listings. Keep the app free for attendees. | Consumer discovery rarely monetizes (Partiful [[6]](#sources)); Eventbrite's growth area is ads for creators, up 38% year over year [[16]](#sources) |
| 2 | **Don't sell tickets.** Link out to the host's existing ticketing. | Ticketing is consolidating around scaled players (Fever + DICE, Bending Spoons) [[1]](#sources)[[3]](#sources) |
| 3 | **Design for tight budgets.** Put free and low-cost events, and a group price cap in Crew Blend, up front. | Canadians and Gen Z are cutting entertainment spending [[7]](#sources); cost keeps young people home [[9]](#sources) |
| 4 | **Replace the public "Spotify for local events" tagline** with a line we can own, such as *"Toronto's events, tuned to you and your crew"*. Keep the Spotify comparison for internal pitches only. | Spotify already recommends local concerts and venues [[10]](#sources)[[11]](#sources) |
| 5 | **Own our event data.** Get supply from hosts claiming or creating listings, plus partnerships. Don't depend on other platforms' APIs. | Eventbrite shut off its public event search API in 2020 [[17]](#sources) |
| 6 | **Measure real attendance** with check-ins, as our north star already does, and report it honestly to hosts and investors. | IRL collapsed on fake engagement [[5]](#sources) |
| 7 | **Start with one group in one area:** e.g. students and young professionals downtown, 2–3 scenes. | Motivez targets Toronto students too (see [competitor analysis](./competitor-analysis.md)); building density in one area beats being thin everywhere |
| 8 | **Test a paid "Crew Night" format:** a curated group outing for solo attendees. | Timeleft shows people pay for curated IRL social experiences [[12]](#sources) |

## 1. Market structure

### Consolidation is the main trend

| Date | Event | What it signals |
|---|---|---|
| Jan 2024 | Bending Spoons acquires **Meetup** (60M+ registered members) [[4]](#sources) | Mature community platforms are bought and run for efficiency |
| Jun 2025 | **Fever acquires DICE**; Fever also raises $100M+ (previous valuation $1.8B) [[3]](#sources) | Discovery (Fever) and ticketing (DICE) combine for scale |
| Dec 2025 | **Eventbrite** agrees to be acquired by Bending Spoons for ~$500M [[1]](#sources) | Down ~71% from its $1.76B IPO valuation in 2018 [[2]](#sources) |

**Implication:** competing head-on on ticketing or broad listings means facing scaled, well-funded players. The open space is **personalization, groups and host insights**, which these platforms don't do well.

### Incumbents are shrinking or flat

- Eventbrite's Q3 2025 revenue fell **8%** year over year to $71.7M, and paid tickets fell **3%** to 19.1M [[16]](#sources).
- Its growth line is **ads for event creators (+38%)** [[16]](#sources). Hosts will pay for reach.

### Discovery-only startups struggle to make money

| Company | Outcome | Lesson for us |
|---|---|---|
| IRL | Raised $200M+ (unicorn valuation of $1.17B); shut down in June 2023 after 95% of 20M claimed users turned out to be bots [[5]](#sources) | Measure real attendance, not downloads |
| Partiful | Popular with under-30s and in 100+ countries; $20M Series A; **no revenue model yet** [[6]](#sources) | Consumer love doesn't equal a business |
| Posh | Personalized, TikTok-style event feed; ~6M users, ~50K organizers, $10M revenue in 2024 from a 10% cut of ticket sales [[13]](#sources) | Personalization works when it's tied to transactions |
| Timeleft | Paid dinners with strangers; 150K diners a month in 200+ cities; €18M ARR [[12]](#sources) | People pay for curated social experiences |

## 2. Demand: will people actually go out?

### Headwinds

- **Budgets:** 67% of Canadians plan to cut spending in 2026 (up from 51%). 44% will spend less on entertainment and 55% will eat out less. Gen Z is the most likely age group to cut back, at 86% [[7]](#sources).
- **Cost of going out:** 61% of UK 18–30-year-olds go out less than a year ago, and 68% have cut back because of the economy [[9]](#sources).
- **Friends won't come:** in an earlier UK survey, "can't convince mates" was a top reason for going out less [[8]](#sources). *This is the problem Crew Blend is built to solve.*

### Tailwinds

- **Social media drives interest, but friends drive attendance.** A 2026 study of Gen Z festival-goers found content from other attendees shapes decisions more than influencer content. Socializing with friends was the second-biggest reason to attend, after the music itself [[18]](#sources).
- **Appetite for IRL social products:** Timeleft [[12]](#sources) and Partiful [[6]](#sources) grew quickly by getting people together in person.

**Implication:** position the app as a way to **spend less and go out better**, with friends. Lead with free and low-cost picks and a group budget in Crew Blend.

---

## 3. Toronto context

- **Policy tailwind:** since January 1, 2025, Toronto has allowed nightclubs in commercial areas citywide, given bars and restaurants more room for entertainment, and updated licensing for live music venues [[14]](#sources).
- **Economic scale:** Toronto's live music venues generate about **$850M** in economic impact and 10,500 full-time-equivalent jobs a year [[15]](#sources).
- **Venue pressure:** venues face rising rent, redevelopment and insurance costs [[15]](#sources). *Demand Signals can help hosts book lower-risk events.*
- **Crowded local listings:** Showpass [[19]](#sources), blogTO [[20]](#sources), Resident Advisor (266+ upcoming Toronto events) [[21]](#sources) and EDMtrain [[22]](#sources) all list Toronto events. Supply is scattered, which supports our aggregation angle.

## 4. Threats to our positioning

| Threat | Evidence | How to adjust |
|---|---|---|
| Spotify recommends local concerts | *Concerts Near You* playlist (weekly, Mar 2025) [[10]](#sources); Live Events feed with 20K+ venues you can follow (Oct 2025) [[11]](#sources) | Stop using "Spotify for local events" publicly; stress non-music scenes and groups |
| Personalized feeds exist | Posh recommends events based on past attendance and contacts [[13]](#sources) | Differentiate with **Crew Blend** (group taste) and **Demand Signals** (host insights) |
| Fans requesting shows exists | Bandsintown lets fans request artists in their city; 100M+ fans [[23]](#sources)[[24]](#sources) | Demand Signals goes beyond artists: any event format, with matched audience size and location |
| Data access | Eventbrite removed public event search from its API [[17]](#sources) | Host-supplied listings and partnerships |

## 5. Sustainability scorecard

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Consumer demand for discovery | 🟡 Medium | Real pain, but budgets are tight [[7]](#sources)[[9]](#sources) |
| Willingness to pay (attendees) | 🔴 Low | Partiful has no revenue [[6]](#sources); paid experiences are the exception [[12]](#sources) |
| Willingness to pay (hosts) | 🟢 Higher | Eventbrite Ads +38% [[16]](#sources); Posh takes 10% of ticket sales [[13]](#sources) |
| Competitive intensity | 🔴 High | Consolidated incumbents plus Spotify [[1]](#sources)[[3]](#sources)[[10]](#sources) |
| Local policy environment | 🟢 Favourable | 2025 bylaw changes [[14]](#sources) |
| Defensibility | 🟡 Medium | Taste data + group graph + demand data build over time, but only if we own the data |
